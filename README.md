## Hero.js

👉🏽 Fix the styling of the `Hero` component. (Title, CTA Buttons, and Hero Image)
<br>
👉🏽 Replace the Lorem Ipsums with the data from the API. (Title and Description/Overview)

<br>

## Row.js

👉🏽 Create Static data for the `Row` component and save to the 'movies' state.
<br>
👉🏽 Get the static data to render onto the screen using the 'movies' state.
<br>
👉🏽Render the static data
<br>
👉🏽 Fetch the data from the API and save to the 'movies' state. If the data is largeRow then use the data from the API: `poster_path` for the image. If the data is not largeRow then use the `backdrop_path` for the image.
<br>
👉🏽 Once you have the static data rendering and movies fetched from the API, replace the static data with the data from the API.
